v 1.22
+ incorporated a completely automated multi-threaded gnfs implemetation by using msieve 
	library calls and externally called ggnfs lasieve binaries.  currently snfs is not
	completely automated - a polynomial file must be produced manually prior to calling
	yafu with nfs().
+ creation of different filter heirarchy in MSVC solution
+ some rearrangement of function declarations
+ changed symbol names of all ported msieve code so that there aren't any collisions
	with symbols defined in msieve libraries linked for NFS purposes (libraries contain
	mpqs and common code as well as NFS code).
+ added a -noecm flag
+ added a flag to specify the directory of ggnfs binaries
+ modifications to factor() to incorporate nfs, with limited size tuning 
	(cutoff set to 95 digits).
+ added a nfs() function
+ added nfs support to windows builds
+ added check for existence of ggnfs lasieve binary prior to starting NFS factorization
+ added checks for unxutils in windows environments prior to starting a homegrown (read 'poor') 
	workaround for 'cat'
+ added a check for the existence of msieve.fb prior to starting msieve filtering.  If one
	does not exist, one is created from the ggnfs.job polynomial file.
+ added an initial filtering run prior to sieving when restarting a NFS factorization
+ searching for last specialq saved no longer requires 'tail'.  dealing with free relations
	meant a more robust solution was required.
+ added logging of NFS progress and results to yafu logfile.


v 1.21 12/22/10
+ first sourceforge release
+ report number of primes in each category correctly when running/compiling with TIMING=1
+ clean up a bunch of experimental code
+ add memory allocation info to verbosity level 3 in siqs
+ fixed a bug wherein the number 1 could be sent to GMPECM's pm1 method, which causes an
	assertion to fail
+ work on batch file input: 
+   lines removed from batch file as they complete
+   more robust parsing
+ automatically refactor composites reported during a factorization
+ ecm, pm1, pp1 methods now respond to cntl-c signals.  if cntl-c is detected in any of
	these functions (or siqs), the factors found so far are printed to the screen, along
	with any leftover co-factor

v 1.20.2 12/7/10
+ fixed a bug preventing squfof from being run on small inputs to siqs, possibly resulting in 
	hangs of the binary.

v 1.20.1 
+ gmp-ecm should now work correctly for all platforms, if libraries are available
+ gmp-ecm, mpir, and gmp versions are properly detected if linked during build
+ reduced memory usage during post-processing, due to issues with memory
	consumption seen on 32 bit windows systems.

v 1.20 11/4/10
+ added SSE2 compiler intrinsics for sieve scanning and large prime scanning in
	SIQS, for the WIN64 code branch.  64 bit windows machines get a 15-20% boost
	in performance from this, for bigger numbers.
+ better cache detection (detects nehalem L3 cache, for instance), thanks msieve
+ attempts to detect nehalem processors (took a guess at model/family codes)
+ detect a few other things (cache line size, cpu brand string, ...)
	+ new flag (vproc) prints TONS of cpu/memory info using cpuid code modified from
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hskdteyh.aspx
+ tweaks to startup splash info
+ added qs estimation for nehalem processors
+ tweaks to the qs estimation process - should achieve a better ecm/qs ratio now
	+ don't penalize if only running single threaded
	+ less of a threading penalty for nehalem/opteron/phenom cpus
+ made bucket sizes one notch (x2) bigger in SIQS.  this gives modern cpus a boost, 
	but hurts older cpus
+ a bucket entry is now a unsigned int instead of a structure with two 16 bit fields
	+ fb_offset is in the high half of the unsigned int, and sieve_loc in the bottom half
	+ gives a small boost to SIQS
+ moved cpu frequency measurement to driver.c, so that it is only performed once when
	yafu is first launched rather than every time factor() is called.
+ fermat now only called if trial division does not completely factor the 
	number.  thanks Warren Schudy!
+ fermat now gives up if 'a' reaches (n+1)/2 before a square is found.
	thanks Warren Schudy!


v 1.19.2 8/17/10
+ fixed bug in squfof introduced in 1.19
+ changed syntax of -seed command line option to take highseed,lowseed pair
+ made it harder to override the default value during small tf optimization 
	(first introduced in 1.17) for DLP composites in SIQS.  higher relation
	discovery rate does not seem to map well to faster completion times when using DLP

v 1.19.1 8/10/10
+ fixed yafu version number to 1.19	

v 1.19  7/28/10
+ added flags -pfile and -pscreen, which enables printing of primes to file or screen,
	respectively, when using primes(low,high,0)
+ doubled the speed of computing primes in spSOE with count=0, by using a mergesort
	of the sieve lines instead of qsort.  Requires slightly more memory
+ fixed bug in multi-threaded sieve of Erathostenes which resulted in incorrect counts
	when run multi-threaded.
+ saved a bunch of useless function calls in 64k versions of SIQS by moving the check and bail
	for block_loc == 65535 up to the sieve scan routine.
+ ~4% speedup in squfof by unrolling the two loops.  This may give a slight (~1%) speedup  
	on larger (> 81 digit) siqs jobs.
+ fixed factor() for very large inputs where the estimated number of ECM curves was overflowing.
	factor should now continue doing ECM indefinatly while the input is out of SIQS range.
+ fixed a bug when generating poly_a values where for small inputs (c42, for example) 
	duplicate polynomial values were continuously generated.  thanks Batalov!
	+ better 64 bit RNG.  
+ several improvements to the sieve of eratosthenes  
	+ sieving the smallest primes in precomputed 64 bit batches
	+ reducing read/write port usage during bucket sieving
	+ recursively calling the fast segmented sieve when large numbers of sieving primes are necessary
	+ halving the number of divisions involved in computing offsets of large primes
	+ greatly reduced memory footprint of bucket sieving when sieving at high offsets
		+ better bucket space estimation
		+ large prime bucket sorting (primes larger than entire interval)
	+ added mod 2310 and mod 30030 cases for sieving larger and larger intervals
	+ eliminated memory reallocation during merge sorting (at a cost of slightly higher memory usage)
+ raised limit of sieve of eratosthenes to approx 4e18
+ fixed a bug causing factorial to break for inputs >= 100 that was introduced in version 1.18
	when primes were changed to 64 bit.
+ added fermat's factorization routine
+ changed logfile to report number of digits, rather than bits, and made it look more like
	the screen output in general (thanks kar_bon)
	

v 1.18  3/26/10
+ more efficient threading in SIQS using a threadpool.  this also fixes some slowdown
	issues I was seeing on Intel Nehalem chips.  Thanks again to jasonp and msieve
	for the simple threadpool functions.
+ threading in the sieve of Erathostenes, using the same threadpool design as in SIQS.
	Efficiency depends on the cpu and the number of threads.
+ sieve of Erathostenes now supports counting of primes > 2^32, up to 1.6e14.
+ added bucket sieving in sieve of Erathostenes for a huge speedup when sieving
	at higher limits
+ fixed bug reported by VolMike where an incorrect number of arguments to a function
	caused a crash.
	

v 1.17  3/15/10
+ Changed siqs find_factors routine to compute the cofactor once we find a factor.  
	This should prevent cases where only one factor is reported as found during
	siqs.
+ Added an adaptive routine for optimization of the small trial division cutoff
	constant in siqs.  The initial guess for this value is usually pretty close, but 
	sometimes not.  This results in a speedup of from 0 to 7% or so in siqs, depending on
	the OS/platform and input number size.
+ fixed a bug in mpqs - relation storage was overflowing for 64k blocksizes.  Thanks
	Will Fay!
+ fixed a bug in the parser: adding a null termination to the delimiter of the strtok function
	fixed some intermittant parsing errors.
	


v 1.16 3/5/10
+ got gmp-ecm default B2 values correct
+ using *_STG2_MAX now works again and works correctly with GMP-ECM.  NOTE: to use
	the default B2 with either gmp-ecm or yafu P+1, P-1, or ECM routines, 
	there must be no reference to the B2ecm or B2pp1 or B2pm1 flags in the .ini file 
	or in the command line arguments.  An updated yafu.ini file with these flags 
	removed should be packaged with the 1.16 binary.  Specifying a B1 value only will
	cause B2 to be automatically determined for either gmp-ecm or yafu routines.  Specifying
	B2 as well will cause the default value to be overridden.
+ changed around the source directories and build files to a standarized form with
	respect to mpir, gmp-ecm, and gmp.  Thanks Brian Gladman!
+ fixed a bug preventing SIQS from working below 141 bits.  Lowered siqs minimum input
	bitsize to 130 (from 150).  Below this mpqs seems to be faster.
+ loop unrolling, a faster popcount method, and better offset calculations using
	the extended euclidean algorithm in sieve of Erathostenes code gave a ~ 25% speedup
	on 64 bit systems.  Also, SOE blocksize now automatically scales with the BLOCK=64
	compiler option, like in siqs.
+ further compressed the data structure used during small prime sieving in SIQS to take advantage
	of the fact that those primes and roots are all less than 2^16.  This reduces the number
	of load/stores to memory during sieving and poly updating loops and results in a slight
	overall speedup: 1-2% on core2 and p3's/4's, up to 5% on opteron/athlon64.
+ added code to prevent yafu from crashing when encountering bad poly a's during filtering.
+ tweaked the various verbosity levels.  default level now provides some status.  thanks
	mdettweiler for suggestions.
+ fixed some inconsistencies in the documentation file docfile.txt.  several of the function
	descriptions had not been updated in some time.


v 1.15 12/6/09
+ integrated GMP-ECM library calls into YAFU, replacing the native 
	P+1, P-1, and ECM routines in all provided binaries.  This capability
	is optionally enabled when compiling on systems with GMP and GMP-ECM
	available.  If not available when compiling from source, the native 
	YAFU routines are used.  GMP-ECM runs single-threaded only (SIQS threading
	is not effected).
+ expanded the capability/readablity of the makefile 
+ added -v and -silent switches to control verbosity.  multiple -v swithes are supported
	with increasing verbosity.  -v -v gives the same output as what 1.14 produced.
	-silent should only print to the logfile, and is not available when run interactively
+ fixed another intermittant bug in Nnoot which was causing small QS jobs to crash 
	(thanks Jeff Gilchrist and Buzzo for bug reports)
+ fixed behavior of the primes function, for small ranges (thanks Z and Lou Godio).  
	Also added environment variables which allow printing of primes to a file or 
	to the screen. By default primes will print to a file, and not to the screen.  
	See docfile.txt for more info.

v 1.14 11/25/09
+ fixed a bug causing crashes in linux32 and win64 builds related to
	the assembly macros in computing first roots in poly.c, for those
	platforms.
+ incorporated latest windows cpu frequency and timing code from Brian Gladman
+ plugged all memory leaks except one originating deep within block_lanczos_core


v 1.13 11/24/09
+ worked on nroot some more, hopefully better now (thanks Gammatester,
  wblipp, and jasonp!)
+ fixed bugs in str2hexz and zGrow which caused crashes when size was
  negative
+ a little more robustness in str2hexz, checking for valid input
+ a little more robustness in expression handler (dealing with negation)
+ added multi-threaded ECM, enabled by the -threads flag, same as SIQS
+ made squfof a little faster, by implementing a state saving structure for
	each multiplier and racing them
+ added squfof_big which can handle inputs up to 100 bits with uint64 as the base
	type.  faster than QS up to 70ish bits.  this is not available on the 
	command line, but is used automatically by QS when possible to do so.
+ removed all global bigints from the code
+ changed all montgomery arithmetic routines to have the modulus explicitly
	passed in, as opposed to being stored in a global structure.  The global structure
	caused problems in multi-threaded ECM, even though it was read-only.
+ got rid of some overhead in the trial division stage of SIQS, for a small
	overall speed improvement
+ made the timing in QS an optional compile time parameter, resulting in a decent 
	speedup of QS (with no timing).  also expanded the optional timing report.
+ added some assembly in the siqs root intialization, for computing the root
	updates.  very small, if any, overall speed impact.
	

v 1.12 9/24/09
+ fixed a bug in restarting a previously finished siqs factorization (thanks Jeff
	Gilchrist!)
+ added a few free's I forgot in 1.11
+ fixed problem in sieve.c preventing using smaller blocksizes than 32768 (telling the
	unrolling in small prime sieving where to break and move to the next level should
	scale with blocksize)
+ fixed a bug causing a crash if run in interactive mode in windows: 
	div_obj.n wasn't getting initialized or free'ed (thanks timbit and 
	Brian Gladman).
+ added some smartness in how many ECM curves are run, based on rough curve fits
	of estimated qs time vs digits, for various architectures.  If this seems very 
	out of whack, please let me know.
+ fixed computing total factoring time in factor(), when threads are in use in siqs
+ added ability to read in optional .ini file to override default settings
+ fixed bug in the shift right arithmatic routine - needed to break out of the 
	leading zero justification if the first word was non-zero. (thanks Andi_HB!)

v 1.11 9/18/09
+ massive overhaul of siqs code.
+ re-structuring of entire factorization flow, enabling better logging/tracking
	of an arbitrarily sequenced factorization job.
+ fixed squfof bug that was introduced when multiplier 1 was done first 
	instead of last.  turns out it was always possible for the last
	multiplier to be returned as a valid result, which was always 1 before, 
	and so it didn't matter, but which is 3 now, which is incorrect. (thanks kar_bon)
+ lowered the bound at which pQS sends things to squfof (to 58), because pQS works to
	very low bit levels while squfof sometimes has trouble when it is up against the 
	limits of 62 bit inputs.
+ fixed a bug in the low level arithmatic routines which broke rho,ecm,pm1,pp1 
	(anything using montgomery reduction) for inputs > 1024 bits.  There is now a 
	significant speed drop for processing inputs > 1024 bits.
+ improved Nroot, much less hackish.
+ fixed a number of small memory leaks in siqs code (valgrind)
+ made 'a' coefficient selection more robust in siqs in order to avoid duplicate
	polynomials (and thus relations), and to avoid an infinite loop condition that
	I'm surprised hasn't surfaced yet in prior versions in which no valid 'a'
	can be generated.  This is still a very hackish routine... need to quit bolting
	on fixes and make it better from scratch.
+ changed some pre-processor statements in poly.c and elsewhere.  
+ added multi-threading capability in siqs, controlled with the -threads command
	line switch
+ fixed a bug wherein rels/sec reported goes mad after loading a bunch of them
	from disk on a restart in siqs. (thanks 10metreh)

v 1.10 4/14/09
+ changed preprocessor directives to shunt MSVC win64 builds away from inline
	asm which it doesn't understand.  In relation.c for sieve scanning and in
	poly.c for computation of next roots.
+ changed gcc inline asm for SCAN_16X to build properly on newer versions of gcc.
	This required changing the "g" constraints to "r" to force the use of a
	register when moving via "movdqa".  Thanks fivemack!
+ Changed project optmization settings to eliminate unneeded optimization that
	was forcing 30+ min compiles on MSVC.  Thanks Brian Gladman!
+ Changed 'mask' allocation to be aligned on the heap to fix crashes when using
	movdqa in SSE2 scanning code.
+ removed all use of NR code

v 1.09 4/13/09
+ SSE2 scanning in trial division of bucket sorted primes.  
+ slightly faster computation of root updates when building the next poly in siqs
	(thanks jasonp, for cmov idea)
+ loop unrolling in trial division code
+ moved special case divisibility checks for poly_a factors from the inner loops
	of the trial division code to a standalone loop which is much cleaner and faster
+ no longer store factors of the a_poly in each relation
	*NOTE* this will cause an imcompatibility with previous YAFU versions' savefiles
+ The above siqs improvements give a 3% or so boost to siqs on core2 systems 
	and a huge boost to nearly everything else: 25% to 30% faster siqs on athlon, 
	opteron, pentium3, and pentium4
+ squfof now does multiplier 1 first, so squares of primes are detected right
	away (thanks 10metreh and andi47)
+ added some more #defines, and cleaned up code a bit (needs a lot more!)
+ fixed a couple more gcc warnings
+ made the right shift fixed-length in the trial divison code when doing a mod 
	operation via multiplication by an inverse.  This means the small prime
	variation limit shouldn't be changed.
+ changed the factor base data structure to a structure of arrays rather than
	an array of structures.  This allows multi-up testing for divisibility in
	the trial division routine, which unfortunately, is not faster than the 
	native C code at this point.
+ added -sigma command line switch to use user input sigma in ECM (thanks Jeff Gilchrist)
+ added -session command line switch to use user defined name for the session log
	(thanks mklasson)
+ ecm prints a warning if sigma is fixed via switch or variable and numcurves > 1
+ removed (rels/poly) output in siqs screen status, added to logfile.
+ reduced digit size at which the double large prime variation is used to 82 in siqs
+ all siqs factorizations now store relations on disk rather than in memory
	

v 1.08 3/23/09
+ in MPQS, fixed number of blocks selected for 64k blocksizes
+ fixed a bunch of signed/unsigned and data type conversion warnings
+ fixed a couple bugs with nextprime, and fixed the documentation
+ fixed some bugs with logging - now qs factorizations finished with squfof
	should log the factors found.
+ fixed bug in squfof where input was big enough to cause the initial 
	64 bit sqrt to fail.  will still keep the code in the loop to break
	on failure, in case this wasn't the sole source of the failures.
+ fixed a bug in make_fb_siqs where factors of composite multipliers were mistakenly
	divided out of the input, causing siqs to fail.

v 1.07 3/14/09
+ increased number of iterations performed per multiplier in squfof so that less
	factorizations are missed in siqs DLP.
+ fixed a infinite loop bug in squfof when it detects and logs an error
	(didn't break all the way out of the loop) (thanks mklasson).
+ fixed a bug in relation filtering which (rarely) caused a crash for very
	small factorizations (reading past the end of in-memory relation list)
	(thanks mklasson).
+ added a small amount of trial division on start of siqs, in addition to now
	dividing out small primes found to have quadratic character 0 during 
	construction of the factor base.
+ changed random seeding - just do once per session and record what the 
	seed is in session.log.
+ new input flag for inputting a random seed
+ actually put stuff in session.log now - keep track of what commands are run
+ fixed calc to correctly compute (125*10) - (5^2 + 100)/25 (or similar), 
 which was incorrectly treating "-" as a function and thus giving it
 precedence over "/"
+ changed primorial # to compute Prod(primes <= n) rather than 
	Prod(first n primes)
+ allow for variable number of arguments to select functions.  Also better protection
	for incorrect number of arguments in all other functions.  Ecm, trial,
	and nextprime now treat #curves, trial division limit, and direction as
	optional, respectively.  See docfile.txt for details
+ made pp1() default behavior to just perform one base.  changed factor() to do 
	3 bases of pp1.  Also added in optional parameter in pp1() to select a number
	of bases to perform.
+ made checking for prp's more efficient in the factorization wrappers - saved
	much unnecessary time spent in miller-rabin function
+ when available, now uses SSE2 or MMX to scan larger hunks of the sieve
	array at a time, for a slight SIQS speed improvement
+ streamlined logging of ecm curves
+ added B1,B2 to display during ecm curves
+ slight change to zRandb in how the topmost word is generated
+ added generate_pseudoprime_list()
+ added ability to work with batchfiles.  See docfile.txt for more details
+ fixed a bug in SIQS which generated incorrect relations in really big factorizations
+ changed verbosity flag slightly:  VFLAG = 0 now means total silence to screen,
	VFLAG = 1 means maximum verbosity.
+ fixed incorrect report of multiplier as a factor in qs routine
+ made the blocksize used in SIQS a compile time constant.  This is less convienient 
	because now different versions of the code are needed for different CPUs, but
	it is 3-4% faster.  


v 1.06 1/22/08
+ tweaked parameters for large jobs, and allow SIQS to run up to 125 digits.
+ loop unrolling during trial division of bucketized primes for a small
	performance improvement in siqs
+ better small prime variation parameters, for a decent performance improvement
	in siqs
+ expanded preprocessor directive functionality throughout library
+ fixed bug which caused a string to overflow when printing factors
+ added more info to sieving stage screen display
+ made a smallmpqs routine, which will be needed for TLP siqs.  Not
	currently accessable from the interface.
+ bugfixes (several reported by Jeff Gilchrist)
+ win32 version now built with mingw32-gcc, for a large performance increase essentially 
	everywhere arbitrary precision arithmatic is used (roughly 2x faster 
	pm1, pp1, ecm on xeon/p4/amd; and about 1.6x faster pm1, pp1, ecm on core2) 
	See the README for more info on which executable you should be using.
+ wrote assembly routines for MSVC 32 bit builds for TFM macros and other
	multiple precision arithmetic.  This results in a performance improvement over
	no-assembly if compiled by MSVC, but nowhere near the performance improvement
	over the mingw32-gcc with assembly builds.
+ fixed stall in squfof routine (detects infinite loop and breaks out) (thanks 
	Jeff Gilchrist)
+ check for factoring 0 (thanks Andi_HB)
+ fixed some memory leaks in rho,pm1,pp1,ecm: needed to free constants defined
	for montgomery arithmetic.
+ fixed some warnings generated by gcc 3.2.3 -Wall
+ fixed a few bugs, and now using TFM monty reduction for all rho,pp1,pm1, and ecm jobs, 
	regardless of size. this makes those factorization routines much faster for 
	inputs larger than 1024 bits,
+ significant improvements to the arbirary precision expression parser and underlying
	arithmetic routines.  Things should work much better (and faster) now for 
	large inputs.
+ first successful build on 64 bit MSVC.  64 bit windows users will see significant 
	performance improvements in all factorization routines.  Many thanks to Jeff
	Gilchrist for performing the compilation, lots of benchmarking, and dealing
	with many updates from me.  See the README for more info on which executable you 
	should be using.

v 1.05 12/9/08
+ better random number generation and seeding.  this became a high priority
	after jobs submitted to a queueing cluster produced exact duplicate
	relation files...
+ tweaks to the main driver to hopefully provide a better method of
	getting the hostname on the linux side, take II. (thanks Jeff Gilchrist)
+ removed unneeded data structures from siqs
+ patched a small memory leak in siqs
+ fixed bug which caused crashes during postprocessing of large jobs
+ fixed bug which caused crashes when running postprocessing more than once in
	a session
+ added 2 new command line flags for SIQS to allow graceful shutdown after 
	a specified elapsed time or after a specified number of relations are found
+ added new command line flag to allow logging to a specified logfile 
	(not specific to SIQS).
+ added a benchmark function for SIQS

v 1.04  12/5/08
+ merged in Brian Gladman's work with msieve's inline assembly routines
	and pre-processor defines to make the assembler work for any 
	compiler, OS and word size.
+ tweaks to the main driver to hopefully provide a better method of
	getting the hostname on the linux side
+ added full parsing of switched options and arguments from the command line
	so that one can adjust things like stage 1/2 bounds in ecm and
	specify the savefile in QS.  For a complete list of options and expected
	arguments, see the docfile.  This option parsing is ignored in pipes
	or redirects.
+ changed the format of factors found slightly, both on screen and in 
	factor.log

v 1.03  12/5/08
+ fixed most compiler warnings under gcc-3.2.3 (don't know about later gcc's)
+ no longer store all b poly values in savefile
+ consolidated all factorization logging into one factorization log file
+ reverted back to msieve's default Lanczos blocksize for large matrices
+ incorporated fix by Brian Gladman into matmul MSVC inline assembly routines
+ essentially re-did large sections of code pertaining to restarts of saved jobs 
	and saving of large jobs
+ added double large prime variation to SIQS, making use of msieve filtering code.
+ re-did large prime sieving, making things more cache friendly as
	well as adding in a tiling of the factor base.  All buckets are now
	4 bytes rather than 8 bytes.  
+ added ability to parse command line expressions (no flags, yet.  all
	program globals are default, like pp1,pm1 stage 1/2 bounds, etc)
+ removed squfof logging.  Still accessible independantly as a function, but
	results don't go to the logfile.  also reduced some other overhead to
	make it faster for SIQS double large primes.

v 1.02  11/9/08
+ added checks to input of rsa (thanks VolMike)
+ additional limit enforcement in primes, similar to that in rsa
	(thanks tmorrow)
+ complete reorg of code
+ windows build with VC++ 2008 Express Edition
+ update siqs linear algebra code to msieve-1.38
+ removed exact division during siqs trial division.
	didn't really speed anything up, and removal of 4 bytes from fb structure
	may actually make things faster.
+ significantly cut back on the number of (unneeded) checks for bucket
	overflow during large prime sieving.  small speedups across the board.
+ changed versioning system and logprint header format
+ added cpu_id code from msieve, used to automatically choose the best
	blocksize in SIQS.
+ fixed lanczos blocksize at 32768, when the matrix dimension is large
	enough to use it.  I was seeing errors with msieve's default choice.
+ fixed bug in tfm_reduce which allowed the size of the input number to
	shrink to zero.  (thanks 10metreh)
+ fixed memory leak in zMul when not using TFM
+ allowed for low pm1, pp1, ecm stage 1 limits, as well as checks for 
	limits that are too low (<= 210).  Stage 2 doesn't work well if
	the limits are too low.

v 1.01
+ added vlp typedefs and sieving of very large primes to siqs
	+ a couple percent improvement for larger jobs
+ referenced the packed sieve factor base during trial division
	of bucket sieved elements rather than the full factor base
	entry.  not using exact division with this change.
+ fixed bug in size, where large values crashed the program in windows
	+ also fixed bug wherein computing large values crashes the program in windows
+ fixed bug in primes(), where counting very small ranges crashed
	+ also made the interface a little more robust, enforcing limits on
	the range and enforcing lowlimit > highlimit
